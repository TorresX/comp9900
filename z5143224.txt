Week 2

We founded the group, 4 rookies together, so we name it group Rookies. We had a strong discussion about choosing which topic as our project. Wenbo suggested project1 because it's not that hard to achieve, while I supposed by doing project7, we can learn a lot about useful career skills.

Week 3

We finally decided to do project7. I'm going to make backend with Golang instead of Python, that I believe Golang will become the first backend language and take place of java several years later. 
We also discussed about what functions we are going to implemented, and wrote the proposal together. I wrote the "Scope & Technicals details" and epics of "Login+Register" and "Login+Register" part.
